RAG is a hybrid framework that combines retrieval-based and generative methods to answer queries. It retrieves relevant information from a dataset and generates context-aware responses.

RAG can be implemented using tools like vector search engines for retrieval and large language models for generation. Popular frameworks include OpenAI's GPT and Hugging Face Transformers.

Common use cases for RAG include improving chatbot interactions, summarizing large documents, and providing intelligent search capabilities for enterprise systems.
